<!-- # Vivik Landing Page Project

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a landing page for "Vivik", a friendship app targeting Gen Z Indian audiences. The app helps users find nearby friends with similar interests and participate in various offline activities like book clubs, cafe meetups, restaurant outings, and spiritual events. The design will be heavily inspired by the SPAMAPP design provided in reference images but customized for Vivik's specific needs.

We want to create just the landing page not the app.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Creating a visually appealing landing page that resonates with Gen Z Indian audiences
- Maintaining the aesthetic feel of the reference design while adapting it to Vivik's content
- Implementing a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop
- Incorporating engaging animations that appeal to the target audience
- Setting up the proper Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS environment

   - Success criteria: Mobile layout matches design requirements and is visually appealing

4. **Desktop Layout Adaptation**
   - Adapt the mobile layout to work well on larger screens
   - Ensure responsive design principles are applied
   - Success criteria: Desktop layout provides good user experience while maintaining design aesthetics
