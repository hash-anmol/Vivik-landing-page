# Background and Motivation

The user is creating a vibrant, on-brand landing page for "VIVIK", a friendship-discovery app targeting Gen Z in India. The goal is to replicate the reference hero screen exactlyâ€”featuring a bold Archievo Black headline, Inter body text, a lemon yellow background with film-style noise, input form, and hamburger menuâ€”and then iterate with additional features over time.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Exact Visual Fidelity**: Matching typography (Archievo Black for headline; Inter for body), colors, spacing, and the grainy film noise background texture.  
- **Font Integration**: Loading and applying two distinct font families efficiently without layout shifts.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensuring the hero section and stacked placeholder cards adapt fluidly across viewports.  
- **Theme Toggle & Menu**: Structuring the header to support dark/light toggle and mobile hamburger.  
- **Asset Management**: Incorporating a noise overlay (via a lightweight texture or CSS filter) and placeholder cards.  
- **Performance & Accessibility**: Optimizing images, fonts, and form labels; ensuring color contrast and keyboard navigation.

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Project Initialization**  
   - Scaffold Next.js + TypeScript project.  
   - Configure basic folder structure (`components`, `styles`, `public`).
2. **Global Styles & Fonts**  
   - Install and configure Archievo Black and Inter (via Google Fonts or local).  
   - Define CSS variables for lemon yellow, black, white, etc.  
   - Implement a global noise texture overlay (e.g., repeating grainy PNG or SVG).
3. **Header Component**  
   - Create `<Header>` with logo which is "VIVIK" in Archievo Black font (this would be there in the image pasted with the prompt for reference), and hamburger icon menu, clicking which would open a Menu with the site links in the menu 
   - For PC, the header would have the site links in the header directly, neatly positioned.
   - Site links: Home, Our Story, Contact Us, Progress Board. 
4. **Hero Section**  
   - **Component Structure:** Create `components/hero-section/hero-section.tsx` as a named export. Place static content and interfaces at file end.
   - **Layout:** Use responsive flex/grid. Left: headline, subtitle, email form. Right: two overlapping card placeholders.
   - **Typography & Emojis:** Use Tailwind for bold, large text. Insert emojis inline with `<span role="img" aria-label="...">`.
   - **Cards:** Use gray boxes as placeholders, overlapped via absolute/relative positioning. Use `aspect-[4/3]` or similar.
   - **Email Form:** Input + button, styled with Tailwind. Add aria-labels, helper text. Just the frontend is needed for now, the backend would be coded later.
   - **Responsiveness:** Stack columns on mobile, side-by-side on desktop. Ensure text/cards scale well.
   - **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<h1>`, `<form>`), color contrast, focus states.
   - **Integration:** Import and place HeroSection in main page.

### Hero Section: Background and Motivation
The hero is the first impressionâ€”must communicate value, be visually engaging, and responsive. It should match reference image, support accessibility, and reinforce branding.

We want to add a new section directly below the hero section. This section should have a black background and a bold, modern look, continuing the on-brand style. 

#### Content Proposal
- **Section Title:** Ready to find your tribe?ðŸš€

- **Subtitle:** Launching soon near you!

### Footer Section: Planning

The footer should provide a clear, visually distinct end to the landing page. It should reinforce branding (logo) and provide quick access to social media, supporting both brand identity and user engagement.

#### Content Proposal
- **Logo** on the left ("VIVIK" in Archivo Black, matching the header).
- **Social Links** (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) on the right, with recognizable icons and accessible labels.
- Visually separated from the black section above (e.g., lighter background, border, or shadow).
- Responsive: logo and links stack vertically on mobile.

#### Tasks
1. **Implement Footer Component**
   - Success: Footer appears below the black section, logo left, social links right, visually distinct and responsive.
2. **Add Social Icons and Links**
   - Success: Social icons are visible, accessible, and link to correct URLs.
