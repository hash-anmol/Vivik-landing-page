# Background and Motivation

The user is creating a vibrant, on-brand landing page for "VIVIK", a friendship-discovery app targeting Gen Z in India. The goal is to replicate the reference hero screen exactlyâ€”featuring a bold Archievo Black headline, Inter body text, a lemon yellow background with film-style noise, input form, and hamburger menuâ€”and then iterate with additional features over time.

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- **Exact Visual Fidelity**: Matching typography (Archievo Black for headline; Inter for body), colors, spacing, and the grainy film noise background texture.  
- **Font Integration**: Loading and applying two distinct font families efficiently without layout shifts.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensuring the hero section and stacked placeholder cards adapt fluidly across viewports.  
- **Theme Toggle & Menu**: Structuring the header to support dark/light toggle and mobile hamburger.  
- **Asset Management**: Incorporating a noise overlay (via a lightweight texture or CSS filter) and placeholder cards.  
- **Performance & Accessibility**: Optimizing images, fonts, and form labels; ensuring color contrast and keyboard navigation.

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Project Initialization**  
   - Scaffold Next.js + TypeScript project.  
   - Configure basic folder structure (`components`, `styles`, `public`).
2. **Global Styles & Fonts**  
   - Install and configure Archievo Black and Inter (via Google Fonts or local).  
   - Define CSS variables for lemon yellow, black, white, etc.  
   - Implement a global noise texture overlay (e.g., repeating grainy PNG or SVG).
3. **Header Component**  
   - Create `<Header>` with logo which is "VIVIK" in Archievo Black font (this would be there in the image pasted with the prompt for reference), and hamburger icon menu, clicking which would open a Menu with the site links in the menu 
   - For both PC and mobile, the header now has only the menu button. All site links (Home, Our Story, Contact Us, Progress Board) are accessible via the menu modal. No direct links in the header bar for any screen size.
4. **Hero Section**  
   - **Component Structure:** Create `components/hero-section/hero-section.tsx` as a named export. Place static content and interfaces at file end.
   - **Layout:** Use responsive flex/grid. Left: headline, subtitle, email form. Right: two overlapping card placeholders.
   - **Typography & Emojis:** Use Tailwind for bold, large text. Insert emojis inline with `<span role="img" aria-label="...">`.
   - **Cards:** Use gray boxes as placeholders, overlapped via absolute/relative positioning. Use `aspect-[4/3]` or similar.
   - **Email Form:** Input + button, styled with Tailwind. Add aria-labels, helper text. Just the frontend is needed for now, the backend would be coded later.
   - **Responsiveness:** Stack columns on mobile, side-by-side on desktop. Ensure text/cards scale well.
   - **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<h1>`, `<form>`), color contrast, focus states.
   - **Integration:** Import and place HeroSection in main page.

### Hero Section: Background and Motivation
The hero is the first impressionâ€”must communicate value, be visually engaging, and responsive. It should match reference image, support accessibility, and reinforce branding.

### Next Section: Planning (Black Section Below Hero)

#### Background and Motivation
We want to add a new section directly below the hero section. This section should have a black background and a bold, modern look, continuing the on-brand style. 

#### Content Proposal
- **Section Title:** Ready to find your tribe?ðŸš€

- **Subtitle:** Launching soon near you!
and under which again a place to enter your email the box.
