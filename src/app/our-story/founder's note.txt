## Our Story

Hey, I’m Anmol, Founder of Vivik!

I’m really good at a few things: understanding metaphysical concepts, engaging in deep talks, contemplating life, coming up with new ideas, and working on something new every day.

But there’s one thing I’m not great at, and that's making people clearly aware of what I’m doing.

That’s exactly what happened with Vivik. After 10s of requests over a month to describe what Vivik is about, I’m finally penning this down.

### How It All Started

It was a warm November morning. As usual, I was at my desk, writing articles and ideating. I felt bored and wanted to play badminton-my favorite sport. But there was no one to call. If I wanted to talk about life, startups, or even just grab a coffee, there was no one around who truly got it.

For a long time, I dismissed my loneliness in the guise of ambition and work. But it kept coming back:  
“There has to be an app that helps you find friends to connect with in real life, not just chat online,” I thought.

I tried dating apps (definitely not the right fit for platonic connections), social media (doesn’t help with loneliness), and a few friendship apps (no active users, so nothing happened). Nothing worked.

### The Spark

I wondered, “Is it just me? Or do others feel this too?”  
So I went on Reddit and shared my idea-not once, not twice, but three times. Each time, the response was massive: 30K+ views, 200+ comments, and 150+ upvotes. Clearly, I wasn’t alone.

That’s how I came across the idea behind Vivik.

### The Journey

The journey has been anything but linear. There have been days I thought of dropping out, days I thought this idea was a trap, and plenty of nights spent figuring out distribution strategies, business models, revenue streams, and whatnot.

But here I am. I still don’t know where this will end up, but this time, I’m going all in. I’m committed to going from 0 to 1.

### What Vivik Is

Vivik is an app to help you find people nearby who share your interests and actually chill with them offline. But that’s just the idea-not the vision or the whole story.

Here’s what we’re building:

- **FIND:** Vivik finds you like-minded individuals near you through an algorithm and pairs you with them. You can chat, get to know each other, and maybe start vibing.
- **CONNECT:** This is the exciting part-most friendship apps stop at chatting. We’re about finding friends and experiencing things together. In the app, you’ll find activities hosted by individuals and our partners-from book clubs and startup events to party nights and coffee meetups.
- **EXPERIENCE:** We’re starting by onboarding coffee shops and book clubs, so you can vibe on your next fun project while sipping coffee with your new buddies.

### What’s Next

Our next step is to launch a community that does exactly what our app is meant for-even before we build the app.

This is just the beginning. I don’t know exactly where Vivik will go, but I’m excited to find out.

Let’s go from 0 to 1, together.
